## ‚ú®Latest Updates

Discord.js v13 will break this bot so do not use this with it. We have been started working on [v5] which will be out in some days/months with new features and much more are on the way.

- [discord.js@12.5.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js/v/12.5.3)

> Note: If you are hosting your bot in heroku, Please consider upgrading your dyno for running dashboard & bot simultaneously because in free dyno it'll run out of memory(as there are two workers). If you want to run only the bot, turn off the `web` dyno.
